                    Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID‑19) is an infectious disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). It was first identified in December 2019 in Wuhan, Hubei, China, and has resulted in an ongoing pandemic. As of 20 September 2020, more than 30.8 million cases have been reported across 188 countries and territories with more than 957,000 deaths; more than 21 million people have recovered.

Common symptoms include fever, cough, fatigue, shortness of breath or breathing difficulties, and loss of smell and taste. While most people have mild symptoms, some people develop acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) possibly precipitated by cytokine storm, multi-organ failure, septic shock, and blood clots. The incubation period may range from one to fourteen days.

The disease mainly spreads between people when they are in close proximity. It spreads very easily and sustainably, primarily via contaminated droplets produced during breathing, coughing, sneezing, talking and singing. Many larger droplets rapidly fall to the ground, however some can be suspended in air as aerosols, especially in indoor spaces. It may also be transmitted via contaminated surfaces, although this has not been conclusively demonstrated. It can spread for up to two days prior to symptom onset, and from people who are asymptomatic. People remain infectious in moderate cases for 7–12 days, and up to two weeks in severe cases. The standard method of diagnosis is by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) from a nasopharyngeal swab. Chest CT imaging may also be helpful for diagnosis in individuals where there is a high suspicion of infection based on symptoms and risk factors, however guidelines do not recommend using it for routine screening.

                    In all this news , a good oe is that Russia have started there test of covid vaccine and we can say in no more timme tha vaccine will reach world wide and we together can fight with this PANDEMIC
