People are so scared of this pandemic that they do not prefer visiting a doctor even if they are sick.
To minimize the fear, we are developing a website that helps people to connect with doctors and healthcare professionals

The website contains a chatbot application through which people can interact with the doctor and consult them.
People can inform about the situation near them so that other people near them can help by posting their situation
Doctors can post about new developments like new symptoms, it's precautions, etc, and can help people to be at a safer side.
This website can help connect people, in times of such pandemics.
